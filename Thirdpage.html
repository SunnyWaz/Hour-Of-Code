    <h2>Hour of Code is a global movement impacting tens of millions of students in 180+ countries. Every hour of code exposes you to fundamental computing concepts on a level playing field.</h2>
  <button class="w3-btn w3-white w3-border"><h1>Why is this important?</h1></button>
      <h2> Developing computational skills is important for modern learning. Coding calls for problem-solving, creativity and communication.</h2>
  <button class="w3-btn w3-white w3-border"><h1>How can I participate? </h1></button>
       <h2>Spend 60 minutes in class facilitating a coding activity for your students. You can have student volunteers who will be happy to help facilitate the activity with you. 
Encourage your students to take an hour lunch during the week of December 4th to work on a coding activity in the innovation hub.
There are great Coding activities to meet all interest fields. There are also “unplugged” activities that promote the use of coding skills that will take place in the cafeteria.
